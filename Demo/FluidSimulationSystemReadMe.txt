- This folder contains the simulation of a fluid with SPH as described in exercise 3
- The implementation was created with Visual Studio 2015 and is located in fluidSimulationSystem.cpp/.hpp (and main.cpp)

(The switch between test case, i.e. methods for evaluating kernels, cannot be tweaked using the AntTweakBar.
It can only be changed in file main.cpp, method OnFrameMove(), line 1102).
